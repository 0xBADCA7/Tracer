# Installation notes tested on Debian Jessie

TraceGraph is meant to display traces recorded by TracerPIN or TracerGring+mongotrace

Requirements:
-------------

# First install some essential packages before starting
sudo apt-get install build-essential qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qtbase5-dev

# You probably also want to have MongoDB for the traces
sudo apt-get install mongodb mongodb-clients


Mongo C drivers:
# Mongo c drivers aren't in Debian so we're installing them from sources
# mongotrace is using the version 1.0.2, newer versions are untested.
# Skip this step if you already installed this for one of our other programs
wget https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/download/1.0.2/mongo-c-driver-1.0.2.tar.gz
tar xzf mongo-c-driver-1.0.2.tar.gz
cd mongo-c-driver-1.0.2
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..

# If needed, refresh dynamic linker cache to discover the new shared libraries:
sudo ldconfig
# Check:
sudo ldconfig -p|grep libmongoc
# If libraries are not found, this means /usr/local/lib is not in your linker path

If you preferred to install mongo C drivers in /usr/lib, adjust path in TraceGrind sources
See INCLUDEPATH in tracegraph.pro

Compile TraceGraph:
-------------------
qmake -qt=5
make
sudo make install

Use TraceGraph:
---------------
# In case /usr/local/lib is not in your linker path (cf above):
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

tracegraph &
# File / Connect / Connect / trace_xxxx / Select
# Trace / Overview zoom
## convention: x axis = addresses; y axis = time from top to bottom
#   left click + drag        : move map
#   scroll up/down           : zoom in/out
#   ctrl + scroll up/down    : zoom in/out on addresses axis
#   shift + scroll up/down   : zoom in/out on time axis
#   right click + drag       : zoom in
